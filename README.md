The client portal is **Canopy** — this website does not have its own login,
admin area, or client portal.

## Hosting

- **Domain:** `magnumcpa.com` is registered at **GoDaddy**, which also holds the DNS.
- **Website:** hosted free on **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch of
  [github.com/glenn925/magnumcpa-website](https://github.com/glenn925/magnumcpa-website).
- **Email:** Google Workspace (MX records at GoDaddy point to Google). Never edit
  the MX or TXT records when changing website settings.
- **Lead form backend:** Cloudflare Worker — see `SETUP-CLOUDFLARE.md`.

### GitHub Pages settings
Repo → **Settings** → **Pages**: Source **Deploy from a branch**, Branch **main**,
folder **/ (root)**. Custom domain: `www.magnumcpa.com`, **Enforce HTTPS** on.

---

## Updating the Website

1. Save your changes
2. **Double-click `sync.bat`**
3. The live site updates within 1–2 minutes

Or use Terminal:
```
cd "C:\Users\Glenn\Documents\Claude\single page magnum"
git add -A && git commit -m "update" && git push
```

Changes inside `worker/` are **not** deployed by this — run `npx wrangler deploy`
from the `worker/` folder (see `SETUP-CLOUDFLARE.md`).

---

## Security Rules

- The GitHub repo is public: **never** put passwords, API keys, or client data in any file.
  Worker secrets are set with `npx wrangler secret put <NAME>` and stay in Cloudflare.
- Keep 2-factor authentication on for GitHub, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, and Google Workspace.
